# InstaBot!

Instabot is a simple yet effective instagram bot, based on instagram-private-api and some other fancy libraries.
By now it simply build a post by collecting a [random background](https://picsum.photos), a [robot image](https://robohash.org) and a [wisdom quote](https://www.npmjs.com/package/random-quotes), more capabilities will be added soon.

In order to test it just clone the repository, create a .env file inside the directory with:

    IG_USERNAME=
    IG_PASSWORD=
    IG_PROXY=

and run test.ts

Many thanks to [instagram-private-api](https://github.com/dilame/instagram-private-api) for the awesome work.
